---------------------
Copied from various places. Particularly, modern opengl tutorials.

I've modified them for use with CMake, which we can do easily with pkgconfig.

Codes:
1) sdl2_graphs - Direct copy of modern opengl code. I intend to use these with some code I have written.
2) first - (excludable) - trivial example copied from glfw3 example suite. Uses GLEW instead of glad. 
3) cube - (old project) - this draws a cube using vertex buffers and index buffers.
